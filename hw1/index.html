<h2>Design Influences</h2>

    <p>One website that I appreciate the design of is <a href="https://nvbc.org/">nvbc.org</a>. 
    I was able to use this website as a good reference when designing my church's website. It is good because it is clean and simple to use. 
    Another website I like the design of is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>.. It is not only very clean, but also very simple to use. 
    I does a good job of promoting the product, making simple to get information about the product, and simple to purchase the product. 
    <a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/#/">Feedmusic.com</a> is also a great website due to its unique and amazing features. 
    Although having a complex features, it is very simple and user friendly. 
    <ul><a href="https://nvbc.org/">Nvbc.org</a></ul>

<h2>About My Design</h2>
<p> 
    I would like my website design to be to be clean, simple, easy to use. 
    It should have a very simplistic navigational system. I would also like my website 
    to have some cool and fasinating features. However, my website needs to still effectively fulfill
    its purpose and presents the product well.
