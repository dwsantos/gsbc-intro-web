			One website that I appreciate the design of is <a href="https://nvbc.org/">nvbc.org</a>. I was able to use this website as a good reference when designing my church's website. It is good because it is clean and simple to use. Another website I like the design of is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>.. It is not only very clean, but also very simple to use. I does a good job of promoting the product, making simple to get information about the product, and simple to purchase the product. <a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/#/">Feedmusic.com</a>. is also a great website due to its unique and amazing features. Although having a complex features, it is very simple and user friendly.

	</br>
			In the future, I hope to be able to create and edit a website with ease. I want this website to be clean, simple, easy to use, but have cool and fasinating features that still effectively fulfills its purpose and presents the product well.
