<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>David Santos</h2>  
<p> David Santos is a Freshman at Golden State Baptist College at Santa Clara, California.

    One website that I appreciate the design of is <a href="https://nvbc.org/">nvbc.org</a>. 
    I was able to use this website as a good reference when designing my church's website. It is good because it is clean and simple to use. 
    Another website I like the design of is <a href="https://www.apple.com/">apple.com</a>.. It is not only very clean, but also very simple to use. 
    I does a good job of promoting the product, making simple to get information about the product, and simple to purchase the product. 
    <a href="http://www.feedmusic.com/#/">Feedmusic.com</a> is also a great website due to its unique and amazing features. 
    Although having a complex features, it is very simple and user friendly. 
</br>
</br>
    In the future, I hope to be able to create and edit a website with ease. 
    I want this website to be clean, simple, easy to use, but have cool and fasinating features 
    that still effectively fulfills its purpose and presents the product well.
