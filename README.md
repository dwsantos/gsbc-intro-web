# David Santos
David Santos is a Freshman at Golden State Baptist College at Santa Clara, California. He has a Pastoral Assistant Major and a Media Minor. He had the privilege to serve at Victory Baptist Church in Brentwood, California in their media and music ministies. 

One website that I appreciate the design of is [nvbc.org](https://www.nvbc.org). I was able to use this website as a good reference when designing my church's website. It is good because it is clean and simple to use. Another website I like the design of is [apple.com](https://www.apple.com). It is not only very clean, but also very simple to use. I does a good job of promoting the product, making simple to get information about the product, and simple to purchase the product. [Feedmusic.com](https://www.feedmusic.com) is also a great website due to its unique and amazing features. Although having a complex features, it is very simple and user friendly. 

In the future, I hope to gain enough knowledge to be able to add additional features on a website. I want to be able to create a website that is clean, simple to use, and efficiently promote the product. I want to be able to greatly increase the media department of whatever church I eventually go to.
