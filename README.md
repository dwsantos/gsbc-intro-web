David Santos
--------------------------------------------------------------------
David Santos is a Freshman at Golden State Baptist College at Santa Clara, California. He has a Pastoral Assistant Major and a Media Minor. He had the privilege to serve at Victory Baptist Church in Brentwood, California in their media and music ministies. 

One website that I appreciate the design of is nvbc.org. I was able to use this website as a good reference when designing my church's website. It is good because it is clean and simple to use. Another website I like the design of is apple.com. It is not only very clean, but also very simple to use. I does a good job of promoting the product, making simple to get information about the product, and simple to check out. 

In the future, I hope to gain enough knowledge to be able to add additional features on a website. I want to be able to create a website that is clean, simple to use, and efficiently promote the product. I want to be able to greatly increase the media department of whatever church I eventually go to.
